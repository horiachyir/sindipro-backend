# Building DELETE Endpoint Implementation

## Summary
Implemented a DELETE endpoint for the Building model that handles cascade deletion of all associated records.

## Endpoint Details
- **URL**: `/api/buildings/{id}/`
- **Method**: `DELETE`
- **Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)
- **Permission**: User must be the owner of the building (created_by field)

## Implementation Location
- **File**: `/building_mgmt/views.py`
- **Function**: `update_building()` (line 52-87)

## Changes Made
1. Modified the `update_building` view to accept both `PUT` and `DELETE` methods
2. Added DELETE logic that:
   - Verifies the building exists and belongs to the authenticated user
   - Stores the building name for the response message
   - Deletes the building using Django's ORM `.delete()` method
   - Returns a success message with the deleted building's name

## Cascade Deletion
When a building is deleted, the following related records are automatically deleted due to `on_delete=models.CASCADE`:

### Direct Relationships (in building_mgmt app)
- **Address** - Primary and alternative addresses
- **Tower** - All towers associated with the building
- **TowerUnitDistribution** - Unit distributions for each tower
- **Unit** - All units in the building

### Related Apps
- **auth_system**: User building associations (SET_NULL, won't cascade)
- **legal_docs**:
  - LegalDocument
  - LegalObligation
  - LegalTemplate (if building-specific)
- **users_mgmt**:
  - UserAccess records
  - User-building relationships
- **consumptions**:
  - ConsumptionReading records
- **reporting**:
  - Report records
  - ReportSchedule configurations
- **financials**:
  - AnnualBudget
  - Expense
  - Revenue
  - FinancialAccount
  - Collection
- **field_mgmt**:
  - FieldRequest
  - Survey

## Response Format
### Success Response (200 OK)
```json
{
  "message": "Building \"Building Name\" and all associated data have been successfully deleted"
}
```

### Error Response (404 Not Found)
```json
{
  "error": "Building not found or access denied"
}
```

## Testing
To test the endpoint:

1. **Using curl**:
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8000/api/buildings/{building_id}/ \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

2. **Using the test script**:
```bash
cd /root/Documents/sindipro-backend
source myenv/bin/activate
python test_building_delete.py
```

## Security Considerations
- Only authenticated users can delete buildings
- Users can only delete buildings they created (created_by field check)
- All related data is permanently deleted (no soft delete)
- Consider implementing a soft delete mechanism if data recovery is needed

## Frontend Integration
The frontend already has the delete functionality implemented:
- File: `/src/lib/building.ts` - `deleteBuilding()` method
- Component: `/src/components/buildings/BuildingTable.tsx`
- The frontend makes a DELETE request to `/api/buildings/{id}/`
- The deletion is confirmed with a modal dialog before execution
